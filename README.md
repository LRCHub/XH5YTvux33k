(Metro!)
Don't know you on
She sitting here for hours,
ain't been tellin' nothin'
It was all cool
and it was just for fun
(If Young Metro don't trust you,
I'm gon' shoot you)
Too much shit on your mental
Got to switch up the tempo
Youngin' call and get tenfold
Show in here
with the bands folded
Locked in with yo' info
I wanna jump out the window
I seen too many whirls tonight
Would you wanna be my girl
tonight?
Know I gotta keep a them drugs
'round me
I gotta keep a couple plugs
around me
I seen too many whirls tonight
Would you wanna be my girl
tonight?
Know I gotta keep a them drugs
'round me
I gotta keep a couple plugs
around me
Know you wan' talk
when the money come in
Niggas went bad,
they goin' outside,
they never gon' win
I been goin' like ten for ten
Get it on movie, get it on film
Get it on movie, get it on film
Fill my cup way above the brim
I went and got the cup
with the all-white trim
Finna go and dump way
above the rim
Love the nights,
so it's hard to flip
Niggas been lit
when the hard-done hit
I ain't think twice
whenever I get it
I was goin' Shiesty
with the all-black fitted
I was goin' Shiesty in all-black
I was on ten when you call back
Had to think twice
and you fall back
I hit a mean lick,
and you was all rats
I was goin' Shiesty in all-black
I was on ten when you call back
Had to think twice
and you fall back
I hit a mean lick,
and you was all rats
I seen too many whirls tonight
Would you wanna be my girl
tonight?
Know I gotta keep a them drugs
'round me
I gotta keep a couple plugs
around me
I seen too many whirls tonight
Would you wanna be my girl
tonight?
Know I gotta keep a them drugs
'round me
I gotta keep a couple plugs
around me
I seen too many whirls
tonight
Would you wanna be my girl
tonight?
Know I keep a couple drugs
'round me
I gotta keep a couple plugs
around me
Heroes are inspired
Emerging only when needed
Revealing themselves
to the world in a moment marked
by realization of their ultimate
destiny
With backs against the wall,
they ascend the winding path
of their own fate
Barely knowing the edge,
despite coping as living
their whole life as two hands
