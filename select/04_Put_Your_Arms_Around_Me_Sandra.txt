[Originally by Sinead O'Connor]
I have a love that lives in me
He makes me sleep in perfect peace
He loves me strong and gently
He doesn't try to change me
No he'd never ever treat me bad
No he'd never call me names
He erases every memory of pain
You Put Your Arms Around Me
Oh since the day you found me
I've been... I've been free
I love the life you've given me
We are each other's family
And I never ever treat you bad
And I never call you names
I will erase every memory of shame
You wrap yourself around me
Oh since the day you found me
I've been... I've been me
You Put Your Arms Around Me
Oh since the day you found me
I've been... I've been free
You wrapped yourself around me
Oh since the day you found me
I've been... I've been me
